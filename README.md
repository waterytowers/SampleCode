# Visa Developer Platform - Sample Code Snippets

This repository hosts the sample code snippets for the [Visa Developer Platform](https://vdp.visa.com/)

If you are new to the Visa Developer Platform, please take a look at our [Getting Started Guide](https://vdp.visa.com/vdpguide#get-started-overview) which walks you through the steps to make a basic helloworld API call.

Once you are comfortable with the same and have also explored the documentation to know about the various API that Visa exposes, you can then use the sample code on this site as a starting point in your journey towards building your application.

Currently, the code snippets are provided in 6 languages under the [VisaAPICalls](SampleCode/VisaAPICalls) folder.

The Cybersource and Visa Checkout samples demonstrate how to make an API call that uses the x-pay-token authentication method.

The Visa Direct sample demonstrates how to make an API call that uses the two-way (Mutual) SSL authentication method.

The Java sample code also has an example of a Visa Token Service API call which uses payload encryption.
